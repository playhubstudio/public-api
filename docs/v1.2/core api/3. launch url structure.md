The Launch URL is what you'll use to start games on your website. You receive this URL from our server after requesting a game launch. This URL is used to launch the game in an iFrame on your website, or you can use redirection.

## URL Structure

The URL template for launching a game through our server is structured as follows:

```
https://<game_provider_base_url>?<query_parameters>
```

Where:
- `<game_provider_base_url>`: This is the base URL required to initiate the game launch.
- `<query_parameters>`: These are the specific request parameters, formatted as a query string, necessary to start the selected game.

### Required Parameters

Every launch URL must include these three parameters:

| Parameter | Description                           | Example        |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| game      | Unique game identifier                | ph_limbo_97    |
| locale    | Language code (ISO 639-1)             | en-us          |
| currency  | Currency code (ISO 4217)              | USD            |

### Optional Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                               | Default |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| levels           | Enable/disable internal free rounds system | true    |
| showBaseCurrency | Show base currency equivalent values      | true    |

#### Free rounds / Levels

Multiple games have internal levels system, which can be disabled if needed. Every new level gives a player free rounds (amount based on general configuration).
If you haven't integrated free rounds yet, or don't want to use internal free rounds, you can disable levels in the game launcher. This will prevent the game from showing the levels screen and will not give free rounds (internal) to the player.

To disable levels you need to use: `?levels=false` in the launcher URL

Example:
`https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/ph_hmstr_97/?levels=false`

#### Example

```
https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/ph_limbo_97/
?locale=en-us
&currency=USD
&levels=false
```

By disabling levels you still can use external free rounds, which you can create with additional API requests.

#### Show base currency

- **showBaseCurrency**: Boolean value indicating whether to display the base currency equivalent under some fields. Default is `true`.
