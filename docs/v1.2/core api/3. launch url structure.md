The Launch URL is what you'll use to start games on your website. You receive this URL from our server after requesting a game launch. This URL is used to launch the game in an iFrame on your website, or you can use redirection.

## URL Structure

The URL template for launching a game through our server is structured as follows:

```
https://<game provider base url>?<query parameters>
```

Where:

- `<game provider base url>`: This is the base URL required to initiate the game launch.
- `<query parameters>`: These are the specific request parameters, formatted as a query string, necessary to start the selected game.

**Base URLs**

| Environment | Base URL                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Staging     | https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com |
| Production  | https://prod.fastplaynetwork.com    |

**Examples**

- Staging `https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/<game id>/?`
- Production `https://prod.fastplaynetwork.com/games/<game id>/?`

## Parameters

**Boolean Values**

For parameters that accept boolean values, you can use any of the following formats:

| Meaning            | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |

| To Disable (false) | false    | 0        | no       |

**Notice:** The default value depends on the feature. It is recommended to always explicitly set the value.

## Optional Parameters

| Parameter                    | Description                                                         | Default |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| levels                       | Enable/disable internal free rounds system                          | true    |
| show_base_currency           | Show base currency equivalent values                                | true    |
| prevent_multi_session        | Prevent opening the our games in multiple browser tabs              | false   |
| free-rounds-decline          | Display Decline button in free rounds confirmation window           | true    |
| free-rounds-bet-amount-fixed | Fix bet at maximum amount, preventing lower bets during free rounds | false   |

### Free rounds / Levels

Multiple games have internal levels system, which can be disabled if needed. Every new level gives a player free rounds (amount based on general configuration).
If you haven't integrated free rounds yet, or don't want to use internal free rounds, you can disable levels in the game launcher. This will prevent the game from showing the levels screen and will not give free rounds (internal) to the player.

To disable levels you need to use: `?levels=false` in the launcher URL

By disabling levels you still can use external free rounds, which you can create with additional API requests.

#### Free rounds options

- **free-rounds-decline**: Boolean value indicating whether to display a Decline button in the free rounds confirmation window. When set to `true`, players will have the option to decline free rounds. Default is `true`.

- **free-rounds-bet-amount-fixed**: Boolean value indicating whether to fix the bet at the maximum amount during free rounds. When set to `true`, players will not be able to set a lower bet amount than the maximum during free rounds. Default is `false`.

#### Show base currency

- **showBaseCurrency**: Boolean value indicating whether to display the base currency equivalent under some fields (bets, wins etc...). Default is `true`.

#### Multi-session prevention

- **prevent-multi-session**: Boolean value indicating whether to prevent our games from being opened in multiple tabs of the same browser. When set to `true`, if a user attempts to open our game in a different tab, the system will prevent this action to maintain a single active session. Default is `false`.

To enable multi-session prevention, use: `?prevent-multi-session=true` in the launcher URL

#### Example with multiple parameters

```
https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/ph_limbo_97/
?locale=en-us
&currency=USD
&levels=false
&prevent-multi-session=true
&free-rounds-decline=false
&free-rounds-bet-amount-fixed=true
