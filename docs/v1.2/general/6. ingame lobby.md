We allow users to switch between different games in the same lobby.  
This is useful for users who want to play different games without having to leave the lobby.

## How it works and how to support this feature on interation's side

When we switch a game we create a new game session and the user is moved to the new game session.  
Only 2 parameters are changed: `game ID` and `game session ID`.
All other session parameters we keep the same.  
To support this functionality on your side you need to make sure that you can handle multiple game sessions for the same user.
