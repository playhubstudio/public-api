Game ID has the following template: <label>_<game-name>_<RTP>, where:

- label - a unique identifier for the game's operator, or white label solution's id for you.
- game-name - the name of the game.
- RTP - the return to player percentage.

For example, `ph_limbo_97` is a Limbo game, with PlayHub (ph) label, and 97% RTP.

Please let us know if you need our games being styled with your own label.
