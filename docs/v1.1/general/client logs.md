In some cases we may ask you to provide us with client logs. In case where we cannot understand what is happening during the integration,  
some unclear error on back end side, or missed logs.  
Client logs on production are disabled by default, but still you can enable them to share with us.


## How to enable client logs on production
Click (or tap) 4 times in the top left corner of the screen (in the corner, within a 50x50 pixels square from the corner) in any game, in any game state.
After the 4th click the page should reload with logs enabled.

## How to download client logs 

Reproduce the bug. Click once in the top left corner (in the corner, within a 50x50 square from the corner). 
A dialog “Download logs” will appear, click OK.  
Logs will be downloaded to your device. In some cases where it's not possible (e.g. telegram game ) logs will be sent to our server.
