# Example of Launcher URL Generation for Game Launch

## URL Template

The URL template for launching a game through our server is structured as follows:

```
https://<game_provider_base_url>?<query_parameters>
```

- **\<game_provider_base_url>**: This is the base URL required to initiate the game launch.
- **\<query_parameters>**: These are the specific request parameters, formatted as a query string, necessary to start the selected game.

## Base URLs

- **Staging Environment**: `https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com`
- **Production Environment**: `https://prod.fastplaynetwork.com`

## Launcher URL:
- **Staging Environment**: `https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/<game_id>/?`
- **Production Environment**: `https://prod.fastplaynetwork.com/games/<game_id>/?`

Example: `https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/ph_limbo_97/?`

### Required Parameters

These parameters are crucial for the game launcher to operate:

- **game**: The unique identifier of the game to be launched.
- **locale**: The language and region code following the ISO 639-1 standard.
- **currency**: The currency code adhering to the ISO 4217 standard.

### Optional Parameters
#### Free rounds / Levels

Multiple games have internal levels system, which can be disabled if needed. Every new level gives a player free rounds (amount based on general configuration). 
If you haven't integrated free rounds yet, or don't want to use internal free rounds, you can disable levels in the game launcher. This will prevent the game from showing the levels screen and will not give free rounds (internal) to the player. 

To disable levels you need to use: "?levels=false" in the launcher url

Example:
 `https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/ph_hmstr_97/?levels=false`

#### Example

```
https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/ph_limbo_97/
?locale=en-us
&currency=USD
&levels=false
```

By disabling levels you still can use external free rounds, which you can create with additional API requests.

### Notes

This URL will be generated by our server and returned to the operator, who needs to use it in an iFrame to launch the game.
