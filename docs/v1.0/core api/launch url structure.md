# Example of Launcher URL Generation for Game Launch

## URL Template

The URL template for launching a game through our server is structured as follows:

```
https://<game_provider_base_url>?<query_parameters>
```

- **\<game_provider_base_url>**: This is the base URL required to initiate the game launch.
- **\<query_parameters>**: These are the specific request parameters, formatted as a query string, necessary to start the selected game.

## Base URLs

- **Staging Environment**: `https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com`
- **Production Environment**: `https://prod.fastplaynetwork.com`

## Launcher URL:
- **Staging Environment**: `https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/<game_id>/?`
- **Production Environment**: `https://prod.fastplaynetwork.com/games/<game_id>/?`

Example: `https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/ph_limbo_97/?`

### Required Parameters

These parameters are crucial for the game launcher to operate:

- **game**: The unique identifier of the game to be launched.
- **locale**: The language and region code following the ISO 639-1 standard.
- **currency**: The currency code adhering to the ISO 4217 standard.

#### Example

```
https://staging.fastplaynetwork.com/games/ph_limbo_97/start.html?
&locale=en-us
&currency=USD
```

### Notes

This URL will be generated by our server and returned to the operator, who needs to use it in an iFrame to launch the game.
